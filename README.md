# Coolhead 
IDEA:- I have always loved hearing natural sounds and lofi music. Coolhead is a lofi + natural sound play station. The user can play any natural sounds of rain, wind, water, cafe, etc etc, combined with lofi-sounds. It will be a full stack application available across all devices i.e. android, web, and ios. It will be open-sourced at least the website.
